## Mobile user-occupancy app for building smart management:
An Android mobile application for presencce detection, data collection and uploading. The data will then be transformed into occupancy profiles for tagert building through data processing. The results will be downloaded, analyzed, visualized and used for simulation to check out the temperature, energy consumption, thermal comfort and so on. Eventually, the system aims at supporting smart building management.
