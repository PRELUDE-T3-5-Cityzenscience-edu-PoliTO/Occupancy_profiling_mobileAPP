*Modelling occupancy in building simulation is still an open issue due to the complexity of profiling actual user behaviours. This is even more evident for residential and other building typologies not driven by rigid schedules. The project aims at developing a method to extract user presence profiles based on an Android mobile application for presence detection, data collection and uploading. Data processing transforms the data into occupancy profiles for each target building. The results can be downloaded, analysed, visualised, and used for automatically feeding dynamic energy simulations, i.e., using EnergyPlus. Initial tests show the high replicability and impact of the proposed approach in simplifying the definition of user profiles under actual building operations to support model validation, digital twin studies, and simulations to check out the temperature, energy consumption, and thermal comfort conditions. Eventually, these results can suggest optimisations and other smart building management use.*
